## System Architecture

### 1. Database Schema (Neon PostgreSQL)

```sql
-- Core Tables Structure

-- Channels
channels (
  id, name, api_config, status, created_at, updated_at
)

-- Products (Master catalog)
products (
  id, sku, name, description, brand, category, 
  base_price, cost, weight, dimensions, created_at
)

-- Channel-specific product mappings
channel_products (
  id, product_id, channel_id, channel_sku, 
  channel_price, status, sync_status
)

-- Inventory
inventory (
  id, product_id, channel_id, quantity, 
  reserved_quantity, last_updated
)

-- Sales Orders
sales_orders (
  id, channel_id, channel_order_id, customer_info,
  order_date, status, total_amount, items, shipping_info
)

-- Order Items
order_items (
  id, order_id, product_id, quantity, 
  unit_price, total_price
)

-- Analytics Tables
daily_sales_summary (
  date, channel_id, product_id, quantity_sold,
  revenue, profit, avg_order_value
)

-- AI Insights
ai_insights (
  id, type, data, confidence_score, 
  generated_at, status
)
```
